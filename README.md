# 🧪 PySphere Assignment 1 – Ohm's Law (Git & Python Practice)

## 📌 Objective
This project is part of PySphere Assignment 1.  
It practices:
- Git & GitHub (version control + collaboration)
- Python basics (variables, input/output, calculations)
- Uploading code to GitHub

---

## ⚡ Ohm's Law Formula
**V = I × R**

Where:
- **V** = Voltage (in volts)
- **I** = Current (in amperes)
- **R** = Resistance (in ohms)

---

## 🖥 Example Program Output

Enter the current (in A): 3
Enter the resistance (in ohms): 10
The voltage is: 30.0 volts


---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Git & GitHub
